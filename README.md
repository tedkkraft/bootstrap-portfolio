***NOTES ON THIS ASSIGNMENT

*This is not the quality that I hope to put out. My apartment is directly above High St. in Columbus on the second floor and due to the protests over the last week it has been difficult to get sleep or focus on this assignement. As class is cancelled this Saturday I plan to use the time to vastly improve on what is essentially a wireframe currently.

I reread your feedback on my last homework, and I have forgotten to name the repo something other than "homework2" but I am nearing the deadline to turn in.

This README is lacking a screenshot, which I did not know belongs in a README and I also do not know how to do that yet. Nearing midnight here. Apologies.

I really appreciate the feedback and will be sure to implement it on my next project.
